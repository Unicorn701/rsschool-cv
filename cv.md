### Leisure time activities

I have maybe not too much leisure time. I work a lot. But when I have my free time I love doing sports (gym, yoga, Thai boxing). I adore cooking, sometimes using recipes from the internet, sometimes just creating something that is coming to my mind. For sure, I love reading fiction books, movies, meeting friends or drawing.
